# Me In Markdown
## Introduction
Hello. My name is Charles Auclair. I am fourteen years old and am in the tenth grade. I am a student at Chatsworth Charter Highschool and I am a part of the magnet program. I also play football for the school. My hobbies include gaming, photography, and travelling.

Over the summer I took a week long trip to visit my grandma in Pittsburgh. It was a cool experience and was interesting to see how much places in the United States can differ from each other. I spent a lot of time over the summer at football practice. I also played a lot of videogames. Overall, I thought it was a decent summer but it could have been better.

My main goal this school year is to pass all of my AP exams. I also want to have good grades in all of my classes (who doesn't). I feel like this school year will be challenging for me as I am taking rigourous courses and multiple AP classes. However, I am up for the challenge and will try my best to do well this year.
